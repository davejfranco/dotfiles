## My dotfile config

This repo contains the different configs of the tools I use on a daily basis

### Requirements
- nvim 
- tmux
- ghostty 
- zsh
- stow (this allows me to create symbolic links of the different config files)

### How to use
Once you have all requirements installed just

```bash
stow .
```

### Notes
- I used to use wsl2 so I have a directory with wsl2 specific configs but maybe I will remove it in the future
- Also changing my nvim config
